Sure! Here are some commonly used semantics queries in MongoDB with examples:

1. Equality: Find documents where a specific field matches a given value.
   Example: `db.collection.find({ field: "value" })`

2. Comparison: Find documents where a field satisfies a specific comparison condition.
   Example: `db.collection.find({ field: { $gt: value } })` (find documents where "field" is greater than "value")

3. Inclusion: Find documents where a field's value exists in a specified array.
   Example: `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [value1, value2, ...] } })`

4. Logical AND: Find documents where multiple conditions are true.
   Example: `db.collection.find({ $and: [{ condition1 }, { condition2 }, ...] })`

5. Logical OR: Find documents where at least one of the specified conditions is true.
   Example: `db.collection.find({ $or: [{ condition1 }, { condition2 }, ...] })`

These are just a few examples of semantics queries in MongoDB. There are many more operators and query options available to perform complex queries based on your needs.
